## Key features

### (Almost) no work

With the calculations done in the backend, there is no need to open another spreadsheet for financing. It is difficult to argue with a machine. Input the values, and Buddyget will handle the rest.

### Simple to use

Buddyget focuses on simplicity. Only splitting long-term costs, that's it. We don't target other audiences, providing everything you'll ever need between you and your roommates.

### Long-term financing

We have the long term in mind. It is likely that you and your roommates will live together for more than a month, and your experience with the app will reflect that.

### Analytics

## Development

This application is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for it's use of JavaScript on the front and back-end.

### Database (MongoDB)

A database for modern applications. With it's JSON-like structure and key-value pairings, it was the natural choice for this project. A huge benefit of NoSQL over SQL databases is the flexibility of dynamic schemas. Schemas can be modified as the backend is developed, allowing for the addition of fields as you code. For this project, I used [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), allowing for less time to be spent on managing the database.

### Back-end (Node.js/Express.js)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open source server environment that handles asynchronous requests. The support and libraries available for a Node.js application is enormous, with the included node package manager. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a fast and unopinionated framework that simplifies server code with basic routing and API support, by adding a minimal layer over Node.

### Front-end (React)

With the advent of modern web development, [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a necessity in the toolbox of a web developer. By modularizing code using components, fast view changes with the virtual DOM, React acts as the front-end for this application.

#### Redux

A state container for JavaScript applications, [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is simple and has a growing community. By separating data from the UI tree, reducing coupling between components.
